# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-Project

This capstone project will give you a taste of what data scientists go through in real life when working with data. It uses the location data and different location data providers, such as Foursquare. This project demonstrates about how to make RESTful API calls to the Foursquare API to retrieve data about venues in different neighborhoods around the world. During the project, I have learn how to be creative in situations where data are not readily available by scraping web data and parsing HTML code. I have utilized Python and its pandas library to manipulate data, which helped me to refine my skills for exploring and analyzing data.  Finally, I have used the Folium library to great maps of geospatial data and to communicate my results and findings.
